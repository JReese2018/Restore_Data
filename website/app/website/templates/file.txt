Welcome to the Report Optimizer
Since Restore's Tableau does not come fully equip with a lot of tools to propel out individual studios forward, I have taken matters into my own hands.
These tools have proven to work in the Pinecrest (FL005) studio, getting us more booked appoints from the credit utilizer, reaching out to lost members, as well as others.
Making data driven decisions is the reason why most businesses succeed.
This page will serve as an overview of what each tool does, how it works, and potential use cases for them
Disclaimer: Visually the program is not the greatest as I am not a UI designer. Functionally, it is.

<h5>Credit Utilization</h5>
Tableau equips us with a credit balance report that can be used in different ways.
Pulling that report and dumping it into here will save you time and get insights that you probably we're thinking about before.
The average runtime for the reports to be analyzed is <b>0.3 seconds</b>.
This tool will give you a report with all of clients how have used a specifed percentage of their pack that they purchased.
If you were to say 60% utilization, the report will give you packs that have been at least 60% used.
The reason that I picked percentages is because it has we (FL005) have seen a trend that the higher utilization there is, the more likely they are to come back when reaching out, thus giving us more opputunity to sell to them.
For example: Jane purchased 10 Base IVs 6 months ago and only used 3 of them while Kevin also purchased 10 Base IVs 2 months ago and has used 6 of them. Who do you think is more likely to come back to do another IV?
In this example, we are looking at 30% utilization vs 60%. We always want people to use thier credits but focusing on those who are already coming and getting them to continue to come can be the difference from hitting goal and not.

<b>We recommend using 60% utilization when using this tool to download the dataset</b>
60% means that this individual pack is used a good amount and that the person purchased it actually enjoys it
<b>We also recommend strategizing when to reach out to people</b>
If you want to make a sale by the end of the month, you might want to start reaching out to people in the middle of the month so they can use the rest of their credits and re-up on anohter pack.
I can't give you a specific date for every service because everone is different but beginning/middle of the month is a great time to use this tool. 
After uploading the file, the program will redirect you to another page with the results on a table as well as the option to download the file.
The table will have the clients Full Name, Email, Phone Number, the pack they purchased, and how many are remaining
When downloading the data, it will come with a "First Contact Rep Initials" column, "Second Contact Rep Initials" column, "Third Contact Rep Initials" column, and a "Notes" column.



Membership Month Comparison
In recent months, there is has been a clear shift into focus of selling memberships. FTVs are great to sell to but old members who are no longer members can also be potential leads to reach out to with a great welcome back deal.
This report will grab any two months that you choose and compare them to see who is no longer a member (Lost Members).
You can use this tool to see who were members this month a year ago vs today (comparing January 2023 to January 2024)
It is also definitely possible to grab a list of all your members that you had in 2023 and compare them to the last full month (so if you're in March 2024, you would compare with a list from February 2024). It will take a good minute but it will save you <b>hours</b>
The average runtime for this tool varies because datasets can be different sizes. Clearly, the larger ones can take longer.
Comparsion models are naturally going to be slower so be aware of that. It is all worht it though. Doing it manually can take a long time and is very unfun to do

When the model is done comparing, it show you some statistics on the amount of memberships on the months that you picked. Ex: "Number of Discover Memberships"
NOTE: The model looks at the number of transactions meaning if you picked more than one month, the numbers will be inflated. For exmaple, let's say picking two months from the report you pulled yields 650 members. The program will say "Total number of all memberships: 650". This does not mean that you had 650 members at one time. It means you had 650 membership transactions across the span of those 2 months.

After you are redirected to the stats page, you will be presented with option to download the Lost Members Dataset.
When downloading the data, you will get a list with the client's Name, Email, Phone Number, and what membership they were on.
It will also come with a "First Contact Rep Initials" column, "Second Contact Rep Initials" column, "Third Contact Rep Initials" column, and a "Notes" column.



Spend Amount [IN DEVELOPMENT]
During crunch time (EOM), it is good to know how your big spenders are.
The last week of the month, Pinecrest typically uses this script to pull all the data from a certain time frame to see where oppurtunity lies
Numbers can very studio to studio but Pinecrest like to look at the <b>last 3 months</b> with purchases above <b>$350</b>.
There is no science or theory behind those numbers, we just find that that is good number to start
However, with this script you can pick any number you want.
